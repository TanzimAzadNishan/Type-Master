Global
warming
is
heating
the
planet
by
regular
increase
in
the
average
temperature
of
Earth’s
surface
due
to
the
release
of
excessive
amount
of
greenhouse
gases
in
the
atmosphere.
There
are
various
types
of
green
house
gases
(such
as
carbon
dioxide,
carbon
monoxide,
chloro
floro
carbon,
sulphur,
etc)
playing
a
big
role
in
enhancing
the
level
of
global
warming.
High
temperature
causes
melting
of
ice
and
snow
thus
reduction
in
amount
of
ice
and
snow,
change
in
water
cycle,
rise
in
sea
level,
change
in
climate,
change
in
weather
patterns,
and
lot
of
changes
in
the
natural
cycle
which
participate
in
the
global
warming.
Such
huge
changing
events
have
forced
people
to
think
seriously
and
take
decisions
against
these
changing
patterns
of
environmental
parameters.
It
has
been
a
serious
issue
and
putting
our
future
at
risk
as
well
as
existence
of
life
on
the
earth.
It
is
considered
that
deforestation
and
rise
in
carbon
dioxide
level
is
primary
issue
of
increasing
global
warming.
Emitting
greenhouse
gases
from
vehicles
and
CFC
gas
from
air-conditioners
are
very
dangerous
as
they
are
empowering
this
demon.
Such
gases
especially
CFC
erode
the
ozone
layer
and
make
holes
which
pass
ultraviolet
rays
and
affect
living
beings
on
the
earth.
Increasing
sea
level
creates
the
fear
of
submerging
coastal
regions
and
completely
finishing
few
islands
in
near
future
thus
making
people
homeless.
Overpopulation
causes
overuse
of
natural
resources
and
technologies
which
is
not
good
for
welfare
of
human
beings.
Global
warming
is
a
gradual
increase
in
the
temperature
of
the
earth
surface
and
atmosphere
all
around
the
world.
It
is
caused
due
to
the
greenhouse
effect
of
increased
level
of
green
house
gases
such
as
carbon
dioxide,
CFCs,
etc.
There
are
various
types
of
pollutants
also
which
involved
in
increasing
the
atmospheric
temperature
of
the
earth.
